# üöÄ Projectile Motion Simulator

An interactive Python physics simulator that visualizes projectile motion with realistic graphics, animations, and accurate physics calculations.

## ‚ú® What This Project Does

- Simulates projectile motion with and without air resistance
- Features realistic Earth background (sky, clouds, grass, dirt)
- Includes 7 different projectile types (ball, golf ball, arrow, car, cannonball, bullet, rock)
- Real-time animation with adjustable speed
- Shows velocity vectors and trajectory comparisons
- Calculates flight time, range, maximum height, and apex position
